## Yet another Angular Template?
**Long story short, yes and NO!**

You may know us from our previous work at [IonicThemes](https://ionicthemes.com) where we build high quality - time saving mobile templates for fellow developers like us.

We don't strive for yet-another-template. We really want to help, ease and make your job more enjoyable by simplifying the development process and learning path.

We hand-pick the best tools available, dive in, invest a lot of time from ALL the team to become experts and then share all our knowledge with you.

Our products are not only a pretty face. They are built to guide you in the development process, exposing difficult knowledge through practical examples.

They are architected to enforce you to stick to the correct-way of building and growing a project.

That is why we created [Angular Admin Template](https://angular-templates.io):

This Angular 5 Template is not just a pretty face, it includes lots of performance improvements such as:
- Server side rendering, also known as **Angular Universal**
- Ahead of Time (AOT) Compilation
- Lazy loading modules 
- Webpack bundling config for different environments such as dev and prod with or without Server side rendering


The reason we did this angular 5 starter template is because we needed it. We are big fans of Angular, we have developed several sites using all Angular versions and when Angular 2 arrived (then Angular 4, then Angular 5) we knew it was going to be a game changer on the javascript framework world. 

>On the beginning it was all dark, but after hundreds of thinking and programming hours of all the team, after many failed tests and tons of frustration we finally did it! 

We managed to have our own [Angular 5 website](https://angular-templates.io) with all the features we wanted:
- Angular Universal
- AOT
- Lazy loading 
- Material Design
- Dinamic SEO meta tags
- Webpack bundling for different environments
- Deployed in AWS
- Blog
- Payments gateway
- Connected with our REST API
- and many more features... 

I also want to thank all the Angular members and community who are actively improving the framework and helping developers achieving their goals. üëè
